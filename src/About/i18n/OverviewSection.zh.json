            "区块链技术赋予个体对加密资产无法篡改的所有权，并且很快会应用在其它类型数字资产和实物资产的所有权与使用权上。区块链和加密资产已经开始颠覆经济中的货币概念，并将成为下一代金融体系最重要的基础设施。",

            "然而，多数加密资产持有者仍然选择在中心化交易所进行交易。他们把资产转给交易平台，在相当长一段期间内放弃资产的所有权。截止2019年8月，用户在中心化交易所上共损失了超过20亿美元的加密资产。另外，黑客攻击事件通常很难区分是外部黑客的入侵盗取，还是内部人员的恶意操作。墨菲定律告诉我们“如果事情有变坏的可能，不管这种可能性有多小，它总会发生。”。因此中心化交易所的资产还会持续被盗。",

            "在这种情况下，去中心化交易所（DEX）应运而生。去中心化交易所本身就是搭建在区块链技术之上，同时采用包括智能合约在内的其它技术以确保被交易资产的安全性。我们相信不必放弃资产所有权，用户就可以在去中心化交易所上自由且低成本地交易。",

            "路印的目标是设计实现以太坊上最佳的基于订单的去中心化交易协议。我们希望为整个行业提供安全的交易基础设施，并提升加密资产持有者的交易体验。我们期待自己的努力能加速区块链技术和加密资产被更多个人和商业实体接纳，促进新一代金融体系的发展。"

            "The security of user assets is and will always remain Loopring's top priority. The three previous versions of the Loopring protocol do not take any custody of user assets at all — traders are always in possession of their assets. The latest version, Loopring 3.0, relies on smart contracts to hold assets to be traded. We designed the protocol in such a way that users can always claim their assets in all circumstances, even when DEX operators are evil.",
            "Loopring 3.0 does not rely on challenging games or fraud proofs as found in Optimistic Rollup. Instead, the protocol enforces proactive and in-time Zero-Knowledge Proofs to attest DEX states to achieve the highest level of security.",

            "We claim that Loopring offers users the same level of security as the underlying Ethereum blockchain — if a feature called <b>On-Chain Data Availability (OCDA)</b> is turned on in v3. Trading on Loopring-based DEXes does not demand traders place any trust in the DEX owners or operators, nor the Loopring team. In terms of crypto-trading, <b>being trustless will become the new standard of trustworthiness</b>."

            "If you have ever run a centralized exchange business, you know the stress and fear of being hacked. Loopring ensures that even if all your servers were compromised, you will, at worst, only lose a couple of Ether that you use as transaction fees (gas). You can always recover from such incidences and resume your business. Using an open-sourced, audited, cryptographically sound protocol means less time & money spent on security, and more on growing your business."

            "Most DEX protocols suffer terrible performance issues — the throughput is too low while the cost is too high. The performance issues prevent those protocols from being massively adopted as no professional market makers or traders will use these protocols as their primary methods of trading. The performance vs. security tradeoff has indeed been a polarizing one.",

            "We believe the way many trading protocols use the underlying blockchain is fundamentally flawed. Loopring takes a different approach known as <b>zkRollup</b> proposed by <b>Vitalik Buterin</b>.  zkRollup migrates most computations off the blockchain and only broadcasts exchanges' new state roots and their corresponding proofs onto the blockchain. In other words, the Loopring protocol uses the underlying Ethereum blockchain mainly as a data layer and a Zero-Knowledge Proof verification thin-logic layer. As a result, Loopring's throughput is as high as <b>350</b> trades per second with OCDA, and <b>6,900</b> trades per second without. The post-Istanbul throughput will become <b>1,400</b> and <b>10,500</b>, respectively. The cost per trade settlement is as small as 0.21 US cent, which can be further optimized, such as using GPU-based proof generation and recursive SNARKs.",
            "We believe Loopring's performance is sufficient for professional traders and market makers to deploy algorithmic strategies and other automated trading bots. By building on top of Loopring 3.0, orderbook-based DEXes can be commercially viable for the first time. We expect such DEXes to begin outcompeting and displacing many centralized counterparts."
