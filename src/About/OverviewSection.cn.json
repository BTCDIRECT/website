        "p1": "The blockchain technology empowers definite ownership — the ownership of digital assets, and soon the ownership of physical assets as well.It is believed to be the disruptor to the traditional notions of currency and will establish the very foundation of the next generation of finance.It is, however, ironic that most crypto - holders are still trading their assets on Centralized Exchanges, or CEXes, by giving up their ownership temporarily.Over the years, more than two billion US dollars crypto - assets that belong to the users got hacked on those platforms. ",
        "p2": "We believe that crypto-trading shall be and can be made risk - free on Decentralized Exchanges, or DEXes, that are powered by blockchain and Smart Contract technology.We also envision that trading crypto - assets on DEXes will be less expensive compared to CEXes, and the liquidity will be aggregated at a much larger scale, if not globally. ",
        "p3": "Loopring's objective is to design and engineer the best - in -class order - based DEX protocol and make it available for the whole industry to improve crypto - holders ' overall trading experience.We expect our effort will accelerate the adoption of the blockchain technology and crypto - currencies.
