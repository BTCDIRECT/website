  "throughputDetail": "Loopring 3.0 can settle up to 350 trades per second while guarantees the same level of security as the underlying Ethereum blockchain, which is powered by zkRollup and a feature called <b>On-Chain Data Availability</b>, or <b>OCDA</b>. If OCDA is disabled, Loopring provides consortium-level security, and its throughput becomes much higher, as shown in the table below.",
  "costDetail": "The average settlement cost for each trade is as low as 0.0021USD, which covers the gas for Ethereum transactions and the cost of proof generation on cloud computing platforms. DEXes can further lower the settlement cost by using cheaper servers in the cloud and GPU-based algorithms. To put things into perspective, most brokers' stock trading fees in the US are in the range of 2 to 7 USD per trade."
